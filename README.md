# CPPND: Program a Concurrent Traffic Simulation

<img src="data/traffic_simulation.gif"/>

This is the project for the fourth course in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213): Concurrency. 

As long as you can read this, it is a "Work in Progress"... Once my submission is approved, I will change this Readme.

The original starter code for the project can be found here: https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Program-a-Concurrent-Traffic-Simulation.git
